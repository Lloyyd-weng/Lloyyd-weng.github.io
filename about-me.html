		<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
		<p>I'm Guoyan Weng, and you can call me Lloyyd(the same pronunciation as "Lloyd").</p>
		<p>I'm a product designer working across user testing, UX design, UI design, prototyping and data analysis to help the product become beautiful, user-friendly and valuable.</p>

		<h2>Design philosophy</h2>
		<p>I think the good design is intuitive, helpful and beautiful.</p>
		<p>I think the design is not just about doing things right but also about do the right things. A successful design is the one that matches the user's demand and keeps the product/team/company growing.</p>
		<p>I think the designer is the bridge between the manager and the executor(programmer or PR). So knowing the source and limitation of both parts is necessary for making an executable design.</p>
		<h2>Something more</h2>
		<p>We are friends if you like snowboard.</p>
		<p>We are friends if you like Nintendo.</p>
		<p>We are friends if you have a Shiba.</p>
		<p>We are FAMILIES if you have a cat :)</p>
