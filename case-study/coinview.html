				<h1 class="article">COINVIEW CASE STUDY</h1>
				<p>Cryptocurrency became very hot in recent years.</p>
				<p>In the late half of 2017, our team tried some small side projects, one of those is the Coinview App. Coinview is focusing on providing cryptocurrency market information. We built an MVP to test the market requirement. And it did make sense and proved that the market was growing big enough to start a career.</p>
				<h2 class="article">Design goals</h2>
				<p>The MVP version was just an imitation of iOS native stock APP. With such limited functions, there was no way to defeat our competitors and stand on the top of the market.</p>

				</div>
				<p>Our design goals were to:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Create a cryptocurrency APP to match the target users' demands.</li>
					<li>Make everything clear and easy for cryptocurrency trader.</li>
					<li>Become the No.1 cryptocurrency platform in Japan and more.</li>
				</ol>
				<h2 class="article">My role</h2>
				<p>I served as the design leader (and also the only designer by the first year) for the Coinview APP between October 2017 and September 2019. I worked alongside a product manager, five developers, and four marketing colleagues.</p>
				<p>My main work fields were:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Build the information architecture for the Coinview APP</li>
					<li>Design the user experience (UX) for the app</li>
					<li>Maintain the design system and deliver the final design file for the developers</li>
				</ol>
				<h2 class="article">Design challenge</h2>
				<p>Things became more manifested when the goals turned into such questions:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>What do beginners and advanced users need?</li>
					<li>What can we do to let beginners quickly get started with the cryptocurrency stock?</li>
					<li>In which ways can we get new users and keep them?</li>
					<li>In which ways can we get continuous revenue to extend our business?</li>
				</ol>
				<p>To answer that, we collected user demands by posting questionnaires through twitter and offline. And we also researched a very similar market â€” the traditional stock market to gain more experience about what the cryptocurrency user desire from our APP.</p>

				<h2 class="article">Design Highlight</h2>
				<h3 class="article">Design for users of different level</h3>
				<p>To answer question No.1, I combined the questionnaire results and data tools like google trends to figure out what is hot and needed in each period of the app.</p>
				<img src="../pic/coinview-google-trend.png" alt="coinview-google-trend" class="article">
				<p>As an example, the keyword "ICO" was a hot one in late 2017, and we online a page which listed all the ICO information with filters that can help users search efficiently. The page had brought in 20~30% of the total user base at the beginning but quickly lost its heat in mid-2018. And we gradually low down its weight and finally removed it.</p>
				<p>After one year's research and feedback, we finally provided those primary function for users:</p>

				<p>Portfolio, Futures Trading for advanced users</p>
				<h3 class="article">Design for user-friendly</h3>
				<p>The cryptocurrency was a new concept for most Japanese people at that time. How to make users quickly and clearly understand what they are facing and doing was a big challenge.</p>
				<p>To answer question No.2, We studied several traditional stock apps to help us find out what are the crucial data and information that users expected to see on our UI.</p>

				<img src="../pic/coinview-user-guide.png" alt="coinview-user-guide" class="article">
				<p>We also made a lot of effort to guide beginners on the main processes when using the app.</p>
				<h3 class="article">Design for growth</h3>
				<img src="../pic/coinview-aarrr.png" alt="coinview-aarrr" class="article">
				<p>To answer question No.3 and No.4, we used the AARRR model as our growth engine.</p>
				<p>Here are some examples of what we did in each aspect.</p>

					<img src="../pic/coinview-membership.png" alt="coinview-membership" class="article--4column">
				</div>
				<p>Referral & Acquisition: An enhanced screenshot share function was designed to improve user referral and acquisition. Adding branding contents and download QR code makes it easier to recognize our product and start to use it.</p>
				<p>Activation: Alert system and widget were built to attract users' attention periodically and also provide them with valuable information about what the market was happening.</p>
				<p>Retention: To let users stay in our app instead of jumping to competitors' apps, a vital function with heavy transfer cost is critical. That was why the portfolio function came to live</p>
				<p>Revenue: We decided to improve revenue capability when the structure of the app was stabilized. Online our membership plan finally helped us get income from advanced users who need high-level functions like Futures Trading and AI alert.</p>
				<h2 class="article">Design result</h2>

				<p>By now, the Coinview app has already become the largest 3rd-party cryptocurrency market app with more than 800,000 downloads. It is also highly rated by 4.6 stars in AppStore with 9000+ votes.</p>
