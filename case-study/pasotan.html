				<h1 class="article">PASOTAN CASE STUDY</h1>
				<p>Pasotan.com is a side project of our team that started in January 2019. It was aiming to introduce pc monitor information, which was just a member's hobby at first. I participated in the project when we decided to turn this potential site into a real product.</p>
				<h2 class="article">Design goals</h2>
				<p>Pasotan was a blog site at the beginning. It was just presenting content made by editors, and users come to the site by searching the keywords that they are interested in.</p>

				<p>Our goal was to help this site gain more traffic and build a business model that can make profits.</p>
				<h2 class="article">My role</h2>
				<p>I led a small team with a developer and a content producer from September 2019 till now. Since it was just a light and agile team, I served as the product manager and UX/UI designer</p>
				<p>My main work fields were to:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Define the business strategy for the product</li>
					<li>Design the information architecture and the user experience</li>
					<li>Run a growth hacking plan with the content producer</li>
				</ol>
				<h2 class="article">Design challenge</h2>
				<p>To make a redesign for Pasotan, there were several challenges to face:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>What is the feasible business model for Pasotan?</li>
					<li>In this business model, how to organize the content for the site?</li>
					<li>What can we do to help this content get found by more users?</li>
				</ol>
				<h2 class="article">Research</h2>
				<p>Since Pasotan was not a highly invested project, it was necessary to find a Blue Ocean Market, which had enough traffic but less competition. So I did some marketing research through <a class='article' href="ahrefs.com">ahrefs.com</a></p>
				<img src="../pic/keywords-diy.png" alt="keywords-diy" class="article">
				<img src="../pic/keywords-gaming.png" alt="keywords-gaming" class="article">
				<p>The result showed that compared with the general keyword like "gaming pc", the keyword "self-making pc" had less competitive pressure but still enough users. Less paid traffic meant our organic traffic could be shown to potential users easier, and less cost when we are doing SEM.</p>

				<p>Also, I found "self-making pc" had more search result than others on youtube, which not only showed the popularity of the field but also pointed out a good way to deliver the content that we were going to generate.</p>
				<p>Last but not least, "self-making pc" was highly associated with "pc monitor", which we were doing right then. So we can quickly transfer the site to the new field at less cost.</p>
				<img src="../pic/pasotan-meeting.png" alt="pasotan-meeting" class="article">
				<p>After presenting the research results to the team members, I decided to turn the site into an affiliate site providing information about self-making pc and receiving affiliate revenue when sending users to other online e-commerce sites.</p>
